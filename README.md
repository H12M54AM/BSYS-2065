## Disclaimer
All content in this repo is uploaded for **future reference and backing up**. Some files may not be effecient and is made to illistrate what I have learned from each chapter. Understand that this repo **doesn't take Time complexity and Space compexity into account**. 

Only a few files don't run, this intentional for **educational purposes**. Some files in one of the chapters may not run. This could be because it is still a work-in-progess.
